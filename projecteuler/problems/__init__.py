"""Project Euler problems

Add attempted solutions to this package as .py files. Module names do
not matter, but modules must define the following attributes:

    number: the Project Euler problem number
    answer: the correct answer to the problem (optional, defaults to None)
    solution: a callable which attempts to calculate the answer

Modules must not raise any exceptions when imported, and should defer
any calculations until their solution function is called, for accurate
timing results. (Basic setup is acceptable, such as initializing arrays
that are provided in the question.)

Solutions may raise exceptions when called: these will be recorded and
will count as incorrect, but will not interrupt the rest of the program.
